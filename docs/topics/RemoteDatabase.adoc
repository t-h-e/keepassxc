== Remote database support
KeePassXC provides support for opening and syncing database files that reside in a remote location. If you can download/upload the database file via a commandline tool (e.g. rsync, ssh, scp etc.) KeePassXC offers easy to use functionality to open the remote database and/or sync it.

=== Open remote database

To open a remote database, click on the "Open from remote" button on the welcome screen or via the menu select _Database > Import > Open remote database…_

.Open remote database via menu or welcome screen

A dialog appears that allows you to specify a command to download the remote file. Specify a placeholder `{TEMP_DATABASE}` as file location to download the database to. KeepassXC will replace `{TEMP_DATABASE}` with a temporary file location on your system, it will expect the database to be downloaded to.

Depending on the command/script you are calling, you may need to specify input that is passed to your command/script.

NOTE: Opening a remote database creates a temporary local copy. No changes are made to the remote database automatically. You need to sync to the remote database to update it with changes made to the temporary local copy.

=== Sync with remote database
Open the remote sync settings via _Database > Database Settings… > Remote_ to create commands to sync a local database or a temporary local copy of a remote database.

Define a name for your sync command and specify a download *(A)* as well as an upload command *(B)*. Similar to opening a remote database, the command and/or input need a `{TEMP_DATABASE}` placeholder specified where the remote database is temporarily stored. Do not forget to save the command settings with the save button *\(C)*. Remote settings are added as menu entries below the _Remote Sync…_ menu for quick access.

Select the remote sync command from the _Database > Remote Sync…_ menu to start the syncing process and a progress bar will show up in the lower right corner.

WARNING: In case the remote database is changed by another user/process after the downloading command finishes and before uploading again, those changes will be overwritten. Syncing is not an atomic operation.
